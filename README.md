# Princeton Carpool

Welcome to the Princeton Carpool Repository

## Goals
One of the goals in Princeton’s Master Plan is to “ to entice people out of their cars... and reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles...by providing viable alternatives for people to get to work, shop, or recreate.”  

However, many Princeton residents and in-commuters to Princeton from other communities live in neighborhoods and towns too dispersed and distant from their workplace to be served by traditional transit. In their case, the best way to “reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles” is to encourage more carpooling and ridesharing. At present about 2.2% of Princeton’s working residents carpool or rideshare to work. About 5.5% of those who come to work in Princeton from elsewhere each day do so.

We need an “app” that makes it easy for people who want to carpool or rideshare with neighbors or fellow workers to find each other and “hook up” and help us reduce the volume of vehicular traffic in town

This project is a partnership with our friends Princeton Future.


## Dataset Information
Tables with information on Princeton in and out commuters are available in a_princeton_carpooling_app.doc

More information on how these numbers were computed is comming.



## Ideas for Data Usage
-make a mobile or web app so that a user can easily identify or click on his or her area of employment in Princeton. Then click on the area where he or she resides. If he or she finds a “match,” it should enable an easy “hook up.”
